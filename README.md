# E-Commerce Sales Analysis Project

## **Project Overview**

This is a data analysis project that aims to discover the sales and profit patterns of an E-Commerce store. The analysis utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to draw important business insights across timeframes, product lines, subdivisions, and customer groups.
This project is focused on revealing the main insights and the trends of profitability through the analysis of the sales data of an E-Commerce company. The exploration of the dataset carried out by means of the Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries led to the identification of the best months, product categories, and customer segments.

## **Objectives**

1. Analyze monthly sales and identify the highest and lowest months.
2. Evaluate sales and profit by product category and sub-category.
3. Compare monthly profit trends.
4. Study sales and profit by customer segment.
5. Calculate the sales-to-profit ratio.

## **🔸 Key Insights**
---

#### **Monthly Sales Analysis**
- ##### November and December recorded the highest sales, largely due to holiday and festive discounts.
- ##### January and February had the lowest sales, indicating weak post-festival demand.

#### **Category-wise Sales Analysis**
- ##### Among all categories, Technology generated the highest total sales, followed by Furniture, and then Office Supplies.
- ##### However, Furniture had high sales volume but lower margins compared to Technology.

#### **Sub-Category Sales Analysis**
- ##### The Top 3 sub-categories in sales were Phones, Chairs, and Storage.
- ##### Fasteners, Labels, and Envelopes had the lowest sales contribution.

#### **Monthly Profit Analysis**
- ##### Profit peaked in November, matching the highest sales month — meaning discounts didn’t eat margins there.
- ##### December had high sales but slightly reduced profit, likely due to aggressive discounting.
- ##### February and January showed the lowest profit, aligning with low sales volumes.

#### **Profit by Category & Sub-Category**
- ##### Technology dominates in both sales and profit.
- ##### Furniture shows high sales but inconsistent profits, implying cost or pricing inefficiency.
- ##### **Sub-category level** :
  - ##### Phones and Copiers generate the highest profit.
  - ##### Tables and Bookcases cause losses — possibly due to high shipping or discount costs.

#### **Sales & Profit by Segment**
- ##### Consumer Segment has the largest sales volume, contributing the most to revenue.
- ##### Corporate Segment shows a higher profit ratio relative to sales — indicating better pricing discipline.
- ##### Home Office segment lags behind in both.

#### **Sales-to-Profit Ratio**
- ##### The average sales-to-profit ratio is around 13:1, meaning for every ₹13 in sales, the business earns ₹1 profit.
- ##### Ratios vary by product line — Technology has the most favorable ratio, while Furniture lags due to high costs.

## **Tools Used**
- #### Python
- #### Pandas, NumPy
- #### Matplotlib, Seaborn
- #### Jupyter Notebook

## **Conclusion**
- Tech products and corporate customers generate the highest profit.
- Furniture requires price optimization.
- Q4 is the month of sales and profit peak with holiday advertising as the main driver.
